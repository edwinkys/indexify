# Reliable Extraction and Retrieval for AI Applications at Any Scale

![Indexify High Level](images/Indexify_KAT.gif)

Indexify is an open-source engine for embedding, extract structured information, and transform unstructured data(video, audio, images and documents). Indexes are always kept updated as data is ingested. LLM applications can query content by semantic search and SQL queries on embedding and structured data.

## Why Use Indexify 
Building a product with LLMs often involves -

1. Ingesting new data, extracting structured infromation, or embedding and writing them to storage.
2. Retreiving extracted structured data and embedding so that products don't respond to user queries with stale data.

The challenges of building such applications are -  

1. Extraction of structured data using LLMs, CV or other models are compute intensive and can hurt the performance of your LLM applications. 
2. Multi-Stage extraction process such as breaking down a document or other media files into chunks, and extract embedding and structured information require building a replicated state machine for fault tolerance, and can be hard to get right.

Indexify solves the complexity of building a durable and fast orchestation and ingestion system for running complex extraction and data transformation workflows for LLM Applications. Indexify assures that content meant for extraction are not dropped in production because of faults in compute and storage infrastructure.
